# Code of Conduct

## Scope

_This Code of Conduct is not endorsed by the DSA or the Philly DSA and does not apply to interactions you may have outside of specifically Philly DSA Tech spaces. This Code of Conduct was voted on and endorsed by the Philly DSA Tech Team on **TKTK**._

This document applies as broadly as possible to the Philly DSA Tech Team; for example: meetings, chat rooms, Github repositories, Signal groups, and any other space (whether online or off) where reasonable people would expect it applies. For instance, if someone sends a harassing text to a fellow member of the Philly DSA Tech Team, just because SMS isn't listed above does not mean that this document does not apply.

## Values

A primary goal of Philly DSA Tech is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. We are committed to providing a safe, respectful, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, religion (or lack thereof), and mental and physical ability. Lastly, we strive to welcome beginners and experienced programmers alike; every member of the Tech Team should feel comfortable contributing regardless of skill level, education, or years working in IT.

Philly DSA Tech prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The administrators will not act on complaints regarding:

* "Reverse"-isms, including "reverse racism," "reverse sexism," and "cisphobia"
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you."
* Communicating in a "tone" you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

## Expected Behavior

Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow members. Be welcoming and supportive of your fellow Tech Team members, whether in person or online; remember that we are all working toward a common goal. Debate and disagreement are an expected part of collaboration, but that should not spill over into demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following are examples of unacceptable behavior; however, we hasten to add that a "major weapon of harassers is arguing whether something is actually harassing,"<sup> 1</sup> therefore, just because something is not on this list, does not mean that it is acceptable.

* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.


* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others


* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.


* Incitement or threats of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Deliberate intimidation.


* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.


* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

## Reporting / Incident Handling / Enforcement

If you are being harassed by a member of the Philly DSA Tech Team, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the administrators at **[email address or other contact point TKTK].** Alternatively, if you do not feel comfortable reporting an incident to the administrators, please contact the Chair of Outreach Committee or a member of the Steering Committee [**TKTK need to get buy in here**] and they will handle as appropriate.

In order to protect members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith.

## Consequences

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Philly DSA Tech Team spaces.
